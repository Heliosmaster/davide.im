excerpt: "Writing is therapeutical: a way for the mind to feel solid,
for the thoughts to be set."

---

Since the very beginning of my online activities, slightly more than
10 years ago, I've always had a blog. It felt amazing that you could
write a few words and hundreds, thousands of people could read it up.

You would feel like a writer, with just a few clicks.

Of course reality was very different, and basically no one wanted to
read the weird stuff that a 16 year old channels through the pages of
his blog, especially when there was no twitter or anything of sort, and the
first posts felt more like a few random thoughts.

But as widely common, writing IS really therapeutical. I did not
notice the extent of that until very recently, when I stopped my student
life. Focused on the "learning" side, the basis of being a student, I
did not realize how much the creative side is engaged, no matter the
subject that you are approaching. Of course during the years of high
school, I was tasked to write wordpieces much more than in my
university life (surprise! you don't write essays as
mathematicians.. mostly) but in general the creative process never
stopped.

And studying mathematics is one of the most creative things
you can do. Of course the technical part is really important, but even
more so the 'thinking out of the box' mentality. A nice quote by
Fields medalist Charles Fefferman:

>  The rules of the devil’s game are special,
though: The devil is vastly superior at chess, but,
Fefferman explained, you may take back as many moves as
you like, and the devil may not. You play a first game,
and, of course, "he crushes you." So you take back
moves and try something different, and he crushes you
again, "in much the same way." If you are sufficiently
wily, you will eventually discover a move that forces the
devil to shift strategy; you still lose, but — aha! — you
have your first clue.

In any case, after finishing my MSc in Utrecht, and starting to work
as a Software Engineer, in both a big company like ASML and a small
startup like Studyflow, the creative process stopped a bit.

Don't get me wrong: especially now at Studyflow, I have plenty of
chances of solving a problem however I want, and to put a touch of
creativity even in the visual styling (something I would not have
believed 10 years ago), even though with a minimalistic side, as
this blog attests.

But the thought processes that occur when
programming are drammatically different than those which occur when
trying to grasp the right words, the right tone to convey a thought,
which I would almost compare it to meditation.

A few years ago, in one of the previous iterations of my blog, "The
cloud dreamer" (Il sognatore di nuvole), I had a category called
"filosofando", which roughly translates as "philosophizing", i.e. the
act of doing philosophy. I guess the kind of post under that category
would be normally called rants. In any case, I would just use the blog
to try and put words to very complex matters, like life universe and
everything. And, as a teenager, you tend to have pretty wild thoughts
and assumptions and weird ideas.

And in some sense, that was awesome, and that is what I have stopped
doing in the last few years.

I just got too busy, too distracted to just stop and think. And this
is precisely what I intend to do right
now. Analyze (and often over-analyze, as I am reminded from my sweet
significant other) reality and better figure out **what I make of
it**, without the fear of being too polarized.

Because the important part of writing is materializing your
thoughts. Even just the very physical act of tapping keys on your
keyboards, in a semi-automatic manner, feels really like the mind
coming to life. You feel like what often authors say, when they claim
they do not actively invent their stories. Their characters just come
to life and their job is simply to record, almost like a stenographer
(but with a more reasonable keyword).

So, a few years ago I would have called this an ágætis byrjun ("a good
start"): I plan to rant a lot more.

Be patient.
